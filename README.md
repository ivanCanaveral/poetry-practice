# poetry-practice

Just playing around with poetry

(!) This repo has been developed using vscode ;) and it assumes that the following extensions are installed:
 * Python
 * Pylance
 * pyLint

## Getting Started

```bash
poetry init
```

By default, poetry will create an environment folder outside your project folder. To help VSCode to detect this environment we have two options:

#### Declare your poetry environments path

You can explore poetry config with:

```bash
poetry config --list
```

You can find or modify poetry `cache-dir`and `virtualenvs.path`, which is usually based on your `cache-dir`.

Additionally, you can get poetry's folder with the following command

```bash
where poetry
```

Now we can use this info to update VSCode project config: `File > Preferences > Settings`or `[Ctrl + ,]`. You can update `"python.poetryPath"` variable now. It should be more than enough.

```
A VS Code "workspace" is usually just your project root folder. Workspace settings as well as debugging and task configurations are stored at the root in a .vscode folder.
```


####Â Set your dependencies folder inside your project folder:

Just modify the poetry configuration, to make poetry install dependencies in yout project's folder:

```bash
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
```

## Installing libraries

```bash
poetry add --dev black
poetry add --dev pylint
poetry add --dev pyright
```
